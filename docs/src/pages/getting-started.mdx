# Getting started

## Initial setup

Bowline is hosted on [GitHub Packages](https://help.github.com/en/packages) which requires some tweaks to your npm configuration. You'll need to point the `64labs` namespace to the GitHub Packages registry and add your personal GitHub token to your own `~/.npmrc`.

```sh
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken={PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}
@64labs:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```

## Add the package

Once you're all set up with Github Packages, run the following in the root of your project.

```sh
yarn add @64labs/bowline-design-system
```

## Configure Webpack

Bowline provides its own PostCSS plugin for both theming and custom CSS syntax. For Webpack projects, the typical setup relies on `css-loader`, `style-loader` and `postcss-loader`. In your Webpack config add the following:

```js
const bowline = require("@64labs/bowline-design-system/postcss-plugin")

{
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css?$/,
        use: [
          "style-loader",
          { loader: "css-loader", options: { importLoaders: 1 } },
          {
            loader: "postcss-loader",
            options: {
              syntax: "postcss-scss",
              plugins: [bowline()],
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ]
  }
}
```

With the PostCSS plugin in place, any `.css` files imported in your project will be processed by Bowline. This means you can use your own theme values as well as several Bowline-specific mixins and functions directly in your own CSS.

## Import the CSS

Add Bowline to your root stylesheet.

```css
@bowline base;
```

That's it!
