# Bowline Design System

Bowline is a lightweight design system meant to accelerate the development of user interfaces with React. Its currently under active and caring development by the people at [64labs](https://www.64labs.com).

## Basics

At its core, Bowline is collection of React components backed by static CSS utility classes, with a PostCSS plugin that can be added to most existing CSS workflows.

All component styles are authored in plain CSS files using a SCSS-like syntax and our own custom at-rule directives and functions. The resulting base stylesheet is compiled at build time against your own theme configuration.

## Goals

#### Accessibility

Adhering to the standards of web accessibility improves the user experience for all visitors. The design system should reflect our commitment to inclusiveness by encouraging best practices from the start.

#### Performance

Because our projects typically focus on producing and auditing high-performance websites, every millisecond counts. We want to limit any uncertainty when it comes to assessing the runtime impact of both in-house and third-party libraries, however small.

#### Flexible constraints

By enforcing flexible design contraints, we become more confident in the consistency of our interfaces. We want to ensure project-level design decisions can be easily codified into the underlying system via a centralized theme.

#### Ergonomics

A pleasant and productive developer experience leads to better software. We should strive to eliminate unneccesary repetition, cumbersome processes, and slow feedback cycles.

#### Compatibility

To create and maintain a design system that we can use across different projects, we must adapt to the technical requirements and limitations of each client's existing infrastructure and partner platforms.
