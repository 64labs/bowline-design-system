# Bowline Design System

Bowline is a lightweight, themable design system meant to accelerate the development of user interfaces with React. Its currently under active and caring development by the people at [64labs](https://www.64labs.com).

## Guiding principles

#### Accessibility

Adhering to the standards of web accessibility improves the user experience for all visitors. The design system should reflect our commitment to inclusiveness by encouraging best practices from the start.

#### Performance

Because our projects typically focus on producing and auditing high-performance websites, every millisecond counts. We want to limit any uncertainty when it comes to assessing the runtime impact of both in-house and third-party libraries, however small.

#### Flexible constraints

By enforcing flexible design contraints, we become more confident in the consistency of our interfaces. We want to ensure project-level design decisions can be easily codified into the underlying system via a centralized theme.

#### Ergonomics

A pleasant and productive developer experience leads to better software. We should strive to eliminate unneccesary repetition, cumbersome processes, and slow feedback cycles.

#### Compatibility

To create and maintain a design system that we can use across different projects, we must adapt to the technical requirements and limitations of each client's existing infrastructure and partner platforms.

## How to get started

To get started using Bowline, check out the [Getting started](/getting-started) guide. From there, take some time to explore the [components](/components) to get a sense of what's available. Finally, you'll want to check out Bowline's [Playroom](https://bowline-playroom.netlify.com) where you experiment, prototype, and collaborate with the system.
