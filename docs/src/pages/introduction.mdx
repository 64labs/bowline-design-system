# Bowline Design System

Bowline is a lightweight design system meant to accelerate the development of user interfaces with React. It is currently under active and caring development by the people at [64labs](https://www.64labs.com).

## Why?

While there's no shortage of component libraries and design systems in the open source world to choose from, successfully navigating the tradeoffs for a given project means finding the right of balance of performance, configurability, developer ergonomics, support, compatibility, and more. Given the varying nature of our work, this meant that a library or solution we used on one project may not be able to be used on the next.

This was especially frustrating when it came to building front-ends with React. We needed a system we could invest in and truly enjoy across projects. So the team set out to bring together some of the best ideas and approaches from our favorite open source UI projects into a system that fit our needs.

## Goals

#### Accessibility

Adhering to the standards of web accessibility improves the user experience for all visitors. The design system should reflect our commitment to inclusiveness by encouraging best practices from the start.

#### Performance

Because our projects typically focus on producing and auditing high-performance websites, every millisecond counts. We want to limit any uncertainty when it comes to assessing the runtime impact of both in-house and third-party libraries, however small.

#### Flexible constraints

By enforcing flexible design contraints, we become more confident in the consistency in our interfaces. We want to ensure project-level design decisions can be easily codified into the underlying system via a centralized theme.

#### Ergonomics

A pleasant and productive developer experience leads to better software. We should strive to eliminate unneccesary repetition, cumbersome processes, and slow feedback cycles.

#### Compatibility

To create and maintain a design system that we can use across different projects, we must adapt to the technical requirements and limitations of each client's existing infrastructure and partner platforms.
