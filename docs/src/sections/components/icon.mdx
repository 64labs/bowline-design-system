## Usage

The `Icon` component acts as a wrapper for referencing symbols in an SVG sprite. The creation and injection of your sprite sheet will need to be handled by you, in a way that makes sense for your project. This app uses [`svg-sprite-loader`](https://github.com/JetBrains/svg-sprite-loader) with Webpack. With this, importing any SVG automatically adds it to a sprite sheet, where each symbol `id` is the filename of the imported SVG. The sprite sheet is injected in the DOM at build time and we use `Icon`'s `name` prop to render our icon from its sprite id:

We recommend importing all of the icons your app uses in a single file so the `Icon` component can be used without additional SVG imports where its used.

```
import './icons/search.svg'
import './icons/cancel.svg'
```

Then anywhere else in your app:

```
<Icon name="search" />
<Icon name="cancel" />
```

### External sprite sheets

`Icon` can also reference symbols in a sprite via their url by passing it as the `url` prop. This is useful if your project does not inline your SVG symbols, but instead wants to reference them remotely.

```
<Icon url="/static/sprite.svg#search" />
```

Keep in mind this approach may have some browser support concerns, though [there are workarounds](https://css-tricks.com/pretty-good-svg-icon-system/).
